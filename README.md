# 2020-Prediction-Model-
**Problem Statement:**
With the 2020 Democractic Primary winding down we read, and hear more and more about electability as a determining factor in the mind of voters as they take the ballot box. At the time of writing this the field has effectively wound down to two candidates with a chance for the nomination; former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. The goal of this project is to take in current polling data available to us and infer which of these two candidates has the best chance of defeating President Trump.

This Notebook will also attempt to predict the outcomes of the March 17th democratic primaries taking place in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.

**What are My Metrics:**


**Executive Statement:**
The beggining of the notebook takes a look at how many polls we are dealing with per state. Of course, there is a lot of polling done in states that are consequential to the election process, and that bores out when looking at a bar graph represented towards the center of the notebook.
